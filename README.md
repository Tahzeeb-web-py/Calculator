# Hi, I'm Mohd Tahzeeb Khan! ðŸ‘‹, Here's my Project on Java with GUI


# Standard Calculator

Standard Calculator is a type of Calculator which can perform Basic Arthmetic Operations. This Project content the Calculator which can perform Arthmetic operation such as Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Division, and additionally Percentage of Nos. 

This Project is totally Developed in Java Programming Langauge with Swing for the GUI(Graphical User Interface), and Base of AWT(Abstract Window Toolkit). This is Very Basic Project to learn the concept of Java Advance(Swing). 

This Project will Help Anyone to understand the concepts and Techniques used. Every Line of the code contents comments which can help you to understand the meaning and use of the every line in the code. 


## Tech Stack

**Frontend(GUI):** Swing

**Backend:** Core Java

## Lessons Learned

While Developing this project one can understand the working of Swing and nested if-else conditions. This project consist of nested if-else condition. As a Topic suggested for this project it has a ability to calculate 2 Numbers at a time. This logic behind the arthmethic operation is developed from scratch(from begining), and easy to understand.
1. Nested If-else
2. Swing for GUI 
3. ActionHandling 
4. EventHandling
5. little-bit concept of Classes and Object.
